If you desire better visuals and smoother performance without updating your computer, a few key adjustments in the NVIDIA Control Panel can make a significant difference.

**1] Open the NVIDIA Control Panel**

Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. This is where all of your <a href="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu">GPU</a> settings are stored.

**2] Set the Power Management to Maximum Performance**

Go to Manage 3D Settings > Power Management Mode, then select Prefer maximum performance. This guarantees that your GPU operates at maximum power when required.

**3] Turn on G-Sync (if your monitor supports it)**

Go to Display> Set Up G-Sync and activate it. This prevents screen tearing and improves gaming performance.

**4] Enable the low-latency mode**

Select Ultra for Low Latency Mode under Manage 3D Settings. This reduces input delay and is excellent for fast-paced games.

**5] Turn on threading optimization**

Set Threaded Optimization to Auto. This enables the GPU to utilize multiple CPU cores more effectively, which improves performance in some games.

**6] Adjust Image Settings with Preview**

On the main panel, click Adjust image settings with preview, then choose Use the advanced 3D image settings for complete control over how games look and run.

**7] Set the anisotropic filtering to 16x**

Change Anisotropic Filtering to 16x in the Manage 3D Settings window. This makes textures appear more clearly, especially from an angle.

**8] Set the Vertical Sync (V-Sync) to Fast or Off**

Depending on your Display and game, switching from V-Sync to Fast can reduce tearing while adding minor input lag. You can also turn it off to minimize latency.

Without the need for additional tools or hardware, these easy adjustments can enhance the appearance and feel of your games.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

Tuning the NVIDIA Control Panel settings can make your games and visuals look and run much better. Just a few easy changes can improve speed, clarity, and smoothness. Try these settings, your graphics card will work even better.
